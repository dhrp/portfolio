        <h1>Share Square</h1>
        <h2>"the best digital pinboard ever"</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Share Square is a visual collaboration tool, mainly targeted at the creative industries. It offers some of the most important benefits of working in radically colocated workspace in an online tool. Sharing, awareness of what others work on and powerful communication are the main affordances.</p>
        <p>The resulting product is a rich interactive, zooming environment. Scroll down for a video.</p>
        <p>Some highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mouse click/drag behavior is dependent upon visual item size, according to user expectations</li>
            <li>Items are technically nested, allowing users' natural behavior for grouping items</li>
            <li>The author of an item is communicated through its attached picture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Based on the initial idea about that collaboration in design teams should be easier Thatcher started thinking about collaboration tools around 2005. As a result he did his graduation project (2009-2010) on a tool to facilitate shared understanding in virtual teams. After graduation he decided there was a significant opportunity to start a business based on his designs. Officially incorporated in April 2011, by spring 2012 the company employed nine people (part-time) and had some 600 users.</p>
        <p>By summer 2012 it was clear further development of the product (built using the Silverlight platform) would be unsustainable and the curtain fell...</p>

        <h3>Design process</h3>
        <p>Please ask Thatcher about the extensive design research he has done with target users, and the iterations of design which were completed even before writing any code.</p>
