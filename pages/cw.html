    <h1>Campuswiki</h1>
    <h2>The information site for Delft students</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Campuswiki is a project which attempts to make local information more available and findable. The site is open for everyone to change the content and is targeted at students. Containing information could for example be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to print from your laptop on the university
        <li>Where to buy a bicycle
        <li>Where to go out
        <li>Where to manage your municipal doings

    </ul>

    <p>Visit the site <a href="http://www.campuswiki.nl/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>The idea was minted by a friend (Joost van Putten). Thatcher has developed the site technically. It is based on MediaWiki, but improvements such as "ask a question", calendars, Google maps, YouTube and other integrations have been created to make fostering a community even better..</p>
