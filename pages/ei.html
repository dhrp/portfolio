        <h1>Exploring Interactions</h1>
        <h2>Researching the interaction between general practitioner and patient.</h2>

        <p>In this master course I have done research into the interaction between general practitioners and their patients. My self-set goal was to make the interaction more open, systematical and relaxt.</p>
        <p>The design approach to design from the context (and not from a problem) is very useful to come up with concepts where the user truly plays the central role. By quickly submerging yourself in the context and looking at the environment you can become inspired. Using a iterative design method: making rapid prototypes, testing these and doing redesign, much can be learned from actual need and use.</p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>A product is developed that helps the patient to see the different options side by side. This helps patients to co-decide and agree on decisions (concordance). The product consists of a paper or digital product in which the doctor can show step by step what options there are. And this all in a nice clear visual representation.</p>
