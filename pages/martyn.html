    <h2>Portfolio of an autonomous artist.</h2>
    <p>Martyn Peskens (my brother) has graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam in fine arts. Most of his work are sculptures, and the best way to represent these is by pictures. In this site the pictures are what is is all about and the navigation of little importance. By hiding the navigation when unnecessary I wanted to make the visitor aware of what the purpose of the site is: To watch.</p>
