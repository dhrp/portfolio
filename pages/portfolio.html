    <h1>Portfolio website</h1>
    <h2>Single Page Web Application</h2>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>The idea behind the interaction of this site is to encourage users to 'discover' items in the portfolio. By showing only a visual hint and by providing the user control over what topics to look at a visitor explores the site rather then 'goes through it'.</p>


    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>Reasoning behind making this website was not only to give this portfolio a general facelift but also to showcase some technologies.</p>
    <p>Amongst other things it demonstrates the power of Ember.js to create a dynamic application completely in Javascript. This means that as you go through the site, the different pages are all composed in your browser, rather than by any server side scripts.</p>

    <h3>Gracefull degredation</h3>
    <p>In case the user (or search engine) does not support Javascript we still provide a decent fallback site. Please have a look at the HTML source. Initially each portfolio item is represented as a regular div with a regular link.</p>
    <p>When your browser supports it it parses all the items from the regular HTML page and replaces them with a Ember view. This has the benefit that we can easily manipulate which items are shown depending on user input.</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>Some of the requirements which were set:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows portfolio items to be in multiple categories</li>
        <li>Is search engine friendly (progresssive enhancement)</li>
        <li>Works well on mobile</li>

        <li>is a discovery process more than a static website</li>
    </ul>
