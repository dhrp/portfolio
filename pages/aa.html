    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>This job started as a masters' course project "usability testing and redesign" but evolved in design and development of a software application. Goal of the course was to learn how to conduct proper usability testing, and develop a redesign based on the foundings. Real companies are invited to make assignments for products they would like to see improved.</p>
    <p>During the course an initial design and a first prototype were built with html and javascript. Usability of this first prototype was tested with five participants using this live prototype and camtasia screen capturing software.</p>
    <p>With the results a new and improved prototype was (quickly) built, this time using Flex builder 1 & Flex builder 2 beta, because it enables a much richer experience. This second Prototype was tested in a similar manner to see improvements, and the results were evaluated and reported.</p>

    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>Thatcher was asked by the company that had given the initial assignment if he could build a final prototype on a contract basis (shown here). For this he found a partner (Jort Nijhuis) and together they did a second, thorough, (re)design.</p>
    <p>Some hightlights of this design:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>The form could be dynamically expanded by dragging on new elements from a list of field types</li>
        <li>Contracts and communications are visually shown as overlapping pieces of paper.</li>
        <li>Several types of filters were available. Amongst which a "from - to" slider, to get a particular version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thatcher built the prototype to be fully functional. Technologies used include Flash, Flex, amfPHP (communication), PHP and MySQL.</p>
