        <h1>HP UX</h1>
        <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
        <p>During his six-months internship with the Hewlett-Packard User Experience team Thatcher worked on a number of phases in the process of developing a new consumer application planned to be shipped with consumer laptops.</p>

        <h3>Personas and user generated content</h3>
        <p>In order to get to know what type of product to make Thatcher set-up user research to find out what people (outside of the silicon valley) were doing most, and what activities they cared about most. This gave a great deal of inspiration for the team about the problems people were having at the time.</p>

        <p>One of the methods applied was that of cultural probe. A small booklet sent (digitally) to all participants (spread over four continents ) in which they kept a little diary and were asked to return some pictures and other insightful information (results shown here).</p>

        <h3>Concept development</h3>
        <p>Ideation, concepting, storyboards. Following a thorough design process many ideas were generated, a number of concepts explored and within one concept various directions explored. The work included creating many storyboards and workflow drafts. Due to confidentiallity no actual sketches or designs can be shown. </p>

        <h3>Concept testing</h3>
        <p>A concept test was decided upon. Thatcher developed the storyboard which would be used in a 80-people user research spread over three US cities. Both focus groups and individual interviews were taken. A researcher would talk the users through the storyboard and the users would reflect on if and how they would use such a particular program. A sample storyboard frame is shown below.</p>
