								    Goal of the course is to learn how to conduct proper usability testing, and develop a redesign based on the foundings. Real companies are invited to make assignments for products they would like to see improved. <br />
								      <br />
							        During the course an initial design and a first prototype was made with html with javascript. Usability of this first prototype was tested with five participants using this live prototype and camtasia screen capturing software. </p>
								    <p> With the results a new and improved prototype was made, this time using Flex builder 1 &amp; Flex builder 2 beta, because it enables a much richer experience. This second Prototype was tested in a similar manner to see improvements, and the results were recorded and written down. A very nice grade was acquired.<br />

                                        </strong>In this second fase I was asked by the company that had given the initial assignment if I could make a final prototype on commercial basis. For this I have found a partner (Jort Nijhuis) and together we heve done a second, thorough, (re)design and are currently finishing the final prototype.</p>
                                          <p>Because the product is new and not available yet, unfortunately                                     no material can be shown. <br />
