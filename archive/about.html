<h2>About KOFFIEDIK industrial </h2>

<p>&lsquo;koffiedik kijken&rsquo; (looking at coffee residue) is a dutch saying of &lsquo;looking in the future&rsquo;. In past times a fortuneteller would come by and drink coffee (hot water and ground-coffee mixed) with you. She or he would then tell your future by looking at the residue left over, in special patterns, in your cup. </p>
<p>KOFFIEDIK industrial has a vision and a philosophy to look into the future. One can give a few words and the company will know, or find out, what product or service is needed, and how it should be. Your idea is therefore in good hands.</p>
